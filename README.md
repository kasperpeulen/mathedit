## Vision

Mathedit should become a solid online mathematical editor for writing math notes,
homework, and other math snippets you want to save. For example, it could be
used for preparing stackexchange posts.

The longer term plan is to make mathedit a bit like OneNote, where you have rich
features to organise your math snippets.
