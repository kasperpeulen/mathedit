/// A [Suite] emitted by a [Loader] that provides a test-like interface for
/// loading a test file.
///
/// This is used to expose the current status of test loading to the user. It's
/// important to provide users visibility into what's taking a long time and
/// where failures occur. And since some tests may be loaded at the same time as
/// others are run, it's useful to provide that visibility in the form of a test
/// suite so that it can integrate well into the existing reporting interface
/// without too much extra logic.
///
/// A suite is constructed with logic necessary to produce a test suite. As with
/// a normal test body, this logic isn't run until [LiveTest.run] is called. The
/// suite itself is returned by [suite] once it's avaialble, but any errors or
/// prints will be emitted through the running [LiveTest].
