/**
 * The Disconnect class encapsulates all operations to be performed on a
 * Firebase when the client is disconnected. This allows you to write or
 * clear data when your client disconnects from the Firebase servers. These
 * updates occur whether your client disconnects cleanly or not, so you can
 * rely on them to clean up data even if a connection is dropped or a client
 * crashes.
 *
 * Note that these functions should be called before any data is written to
 * avoid problems if a connection is dropped before the requests can be
 * transferred to the Firebase servers.
 *
 * Note that onDisconnect operations are only triggered once. If you want an
 * operation to occur each time a disconnect occurs, you'll need to
 * re-establish the operations each time.
